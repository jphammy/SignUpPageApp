# SignUpPageApp

This is a basic Sign-Up Page Application for my iOS Applications course at UMSL that takes in user input for 5 different fields: 

Name,
Username,
Password,
E-Mail, and
Phone Number

Input validation is used on all fields and when the user clicks the Add button, all information is displayed (with the exception of the password).
